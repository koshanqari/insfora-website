# INSFORA - Inspire. Support. Empower.

A youth-led nonprofit organization committed to inspiring, supporting, and empowering underprivileged children through education, awareness, and research.

## About INSFORA

INSFORA is a movement that brings together young minds who act with empathy and purpose — turning intention into impact, and compassion into change. We believe that education should never be a luxury and work to create a better tomorrow through our three core pillars:

- **Inspire** - We spark curiosity and confidence through teaching and expression
- **Support** - We show up for children emotionally and academically — like a peer, not a superior  
- **Empower** - We help them think, speak, and dream on their own terms

- **Interactive Components** - Scroll-reveal animations and engaging user experience
- **Responsive Design** - Optimized for all devices and screen sizes
